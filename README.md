# Project-Proposal

## Project Description
1. For our final project we will be working with the *Seattle Crime Stats by Police Precinct 2008-Present*. This data was collected by the City of Seattle's police precinct and can be found at [data.seattle.gov](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Crime-Stats-by-Police-Precinct-2008-Presen/3xqu-vnum).This dataset includes the police beat, crime type, crime description, stat value, report date, sector, precinct, and row value id. Additionally, the precinct and beat data can be found at this [link](http://data.seattle.gov/Government/Seattle-Police-Department-Beats/nnxn-434b).  

2. Our main target audience is the general public who are interested in Seattle crime statistics. However, other audiences may include the Seattle Police Department and the city government who are interested in increasing public safety. From this data, our audience can ask: How do crime rate changes over time? Where do specific crimes occur? Do certain crimes correlate to one another? 


### Technical Description
3. We are planning to format our final product by creating a Shiny app that allows the user to change how the data is displayed. Additionally, we will be reading in a csv file and perhaps reformatting our data through data-wrangling. We will be using common libraries used in previous projects (dplyr). Through statistical analysis we hope to answer how crime rate changed from 2008 to the present, where the most crimes occur, and how crime might correlate to one another. Major challenges we anticipate include handling merge conflicts, creating an interactive platform/visual, and tailoring our data to our target audience effectively.
